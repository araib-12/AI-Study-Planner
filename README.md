# AI Study Agent

**Turn a learning goal into a structured plan—with explanations, leveled questions, and instant feedback—in one focused workspace.**

---

## Overview

AI Study Agent is a Streamlit application that uses the OpenAI API to help you study with purpose. Describe what you want to learn, optionally attach reference material, and get an organized plan: topics broken down, explanations at the right level, and practice questions from easy to hard. An interactive flow lets you answer in the app, check your work against model feedback, and review mistakes and tips—useful whether you are preparing for an exam or building a new skill.
